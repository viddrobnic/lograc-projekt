# 23Trees - LOGRAC student project

This repo contains the code for the student project at the LOGRAC course. It contains implementation of the [23Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%E2%80%933_tree) in Agda.

## Project roadmap

- [X] Define an ordered set with strict order relation.
- [X] Define a Set that adds positive and negative infinity to an arbitrary set.
- [X] Write a function that expands an ordered set with positive and negative infinity.
- [X] Define a 23Tree with intrinsic height and minimum/maximum element.
- [X] Define a data structure `∈` which gives a proof of element being in a tree.
- [X] Define a decidable set.
- [X] Write a function search which returns weather an element is in a tree. If an element is in a tree, a proof of that is given with the help of `∈`.
- [X] Write an insert function.
- [X] Prove that an element is in the tree after it was inserted.
- [X] Reorganize code using Agda modules.
